2.1 General Compliance. Mentor agrees to comply with all applicable federal, provincial, and municipal laws, regulations, professional standards, and industry guidelines—including, without limitation, anti-discrimination statutes, employment standards, privacy laws (e.g., the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), and health-and-safety requirements.
2.2 Platform Policies. Mentor shall follow all current MentorConnect Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and Opportunity-Posting Policies, each of which is incorporated by reference and may be amended from time to time.

Mentor acknowledges that providing mentorship, training, instruction, or other services may involve inherent risks (including, but not limited to, physical injury, property damage, or financial loss). Mentor voluntarily assumes all such risks and is solely responsible for obtaining appropriate insurance coverage, certifications, and safety measures.
